          Since our founding in 2012, T.S.K.V. Spartacus has grown from a small
          group of passionate lifters to the largest student strength sports
          association in the Benelux.

              <h3>2011: The Concept</h3>
              <p>
                Two friends at Tilburg University, Sjoerd van der Zee and Tijn
                Schraa, came up with the idea of combining strength sports with
                social activities. After conducting "market research" and
                finding significant interest, they began planning what would
                become Spartacus, ending the year with 45 members.

              <h3>2012: Official Foundation</h3>
              <p>
                T.S.S.V. Spartacus was officially established on April 11th with
                the first board: Sjoerd van der Zee (chairman), Jeroen de Beer
                (secretary), and Tijn Schraa (treasurer). The year included
                firsts like clinics, sponsors, social drinks, and TOP-week
                participation, with a fully operational association handed to
                the second board.

              <p>
                A new logo was introduced, still used today. Committees were
                established to distribute workload and increase member
                involvement, creating the foundation for a more active and
                sustainable association.
