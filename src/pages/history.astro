                            <p>T.S.K.V. Spartacus was founded by a small group of passionate students who saw the need for a dedicated strength sports association at Tilburg University. Starting with just 15 members, the association began offering basic training sessions at the university sports center.</p>

                            <p>Spartacus organized its first powerlifting competition, which attracted participants from multiple universities across the Netherlands. This event marked our commitment to competitive lifting and helped establish our reputation in the student sports community.</p>

                            <p>Recognizing the growing international student body at Tilburg University, all Spartacus activities became English-speaking, opening the door to a more diverse membership. This change led to a significant increase in international members.</p>

We simply wanted to create a space where students passionate about strength training could come together, learn from each other, and push their limits. Seeing how the association has evolved and the impact it has had on so many students' lives is truly rewarding."
